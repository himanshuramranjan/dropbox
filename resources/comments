> In FileSystemService, instead of having a complete path that includes both the folder path and the 
file/folder name, we could split these into separate parameters for the methods like createFile, createFolder, uploadFile :

The current design with a single path parameter is more appropriate for a Dropbox-like system because:

It matches the mental model of file systems that users and developers are familiar with
Reduces the chance of path joining errors
Makes it easier to validate complete paths in one go
Simplifies the API surface area


However, you could potentially have both:

Keep the current API for simplicity
Add overloaded methods that take separate path and name parameters for cases where that flexibility is needed
This way you get the best of both worlds while maintaining backward compatibility
